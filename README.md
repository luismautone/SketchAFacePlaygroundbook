# *SketchAFace* Playgroundbook

### Accepted

I made this playground to attend WWDC18: I tried to explain in a simple and interactive way the basics for the sketching of a face.
Once you have chosen the parameters to give to your face and you have tapped on `Run My Code`,
the playground will help you make your drawing through *guidelines*

## Technologies involved:

⋅⋅* **UIKit**, I used *UIBezierPaths* to define the path of different guidelines;
⋅⋅* **PaintCode**, with this vector drawing app I could obtain the right values to build the *UIBezierPaths* as I wanted;
⋅⋅* **CoreAnimation**, I added *CABasicAnimations* to *CAShapeLayers* in order to simulate drawing animations;
⋅⋅* **CoreGraphics**, I used the current *CGContext* for the implementation of a drawing area for the user.
